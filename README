Welcome to the SQLI Testing Environment

This application is intended to provide an offline environment for people interested in hacking/pentesting to test their skills. A basic challenge has been set for each page just to give you something to aim for. This is by no means the only possible target and others may be added in the future.

What this application will do:
-Provide you with an environment to practice SQL Injection
-Expose you to some of the stranger forms of SQL Injection (eg cookies, server variables etc)

What this application WON'T do:
-Walk you through the challenges
